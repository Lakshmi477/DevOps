What is devOps?
Agile method:
1.requirements gathring
2.planning
3.designing
4.developement
5.testing
deploy and maintain
It is the repeat process like a chain.This is called SDLC
Types of methods SDLC
1.Waterfall
2.Agile
3.Spiral
4.Big Bang
5.ETC ETC
WATERFALL METHOD:
1.requirement gathering
2.design
3.implementation
4.Testing
5.Maintance
The next phase is started only after the previous phase is completed 
Cannot accommodate changung requirements
DEV vs OPS:
DEV is agilw it is all about agile/ regular changes and quick changes
OPS is all about ITIL /stability for the product
Automation:
code build
code testing
software testing
infra changes
deployments
Team memebers in devops:
Build and release
developers
testers
sys admins
db admins
DevOps Lifecycle:
code:Developers commits the code
Code build:Deployable Software:Artifact
Code Test: unit integration test
Code Analysis: Vulnerability, best practices
Delivery:Deploy chnages to staging
DB/Sec changes: Every other ops changes
Software testing:QA/functional testing,load,performance tests
Deploy to PROD
Go to live:user traffic deliverted to new changes 
User Approval: User Feedack
keep Monitoring
What is Continuous Integration?
It is the automated process in devops which  generates software and its features quickly.
Code hanges and code commits are happen continusly in github. it is a centarlized repositary next the code will move to the build server. On build server the code
is BUILD,TEST,EVALUTED which genarated software/artifact. This artifcat is stored in a repo , Aritifact repo format is WAR/JAR and DLL/EXE/MSI ZIP/TAR from the repo it will be shift to server
to the testing. After deploying this artifcat in the servers next the software tester will do software testing next it can be shift to the production
The cycleic way
1.code
2.fetch
3.build
4.test
5.notify
6.feedback
repeat mode
The main goal of the CI is Identify bugs and issues 
What is COntinuous Delivery?
